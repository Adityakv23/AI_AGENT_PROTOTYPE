We evaluated our approach on chest X-ray and MRI datasets across five hospitals. Results indicate that federated learning maintains performance within 2% of centralized training while preserving patient privacy. The proposed differential privacy mechanism adds minimal overhead and maintains high accuracy. Cross-validation experiments demonstrate robust generalization across different medical institutions.",

Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets including GLUE and SuperGLUE. The key innovation is a hierarchical attention mechanism that captures both local and global dependencies in text. Experimental results demonstrate improvements of 3.2% and 5.1% on BERTScore and ROUGE-L metrics respectively. We also provide an extensive analysis of the attention patterns learned by our model.",
